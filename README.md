# swiftUIViews - [web](swiftUIViews.dev)

swiftUIviews is an online collection of beautifly designed swiftUIViews by the swift community. Feelin like contributing? Follow the instructions below! 


### Contributing 
First of all, THANK YOU! Any type of contributions are more than welcome, no matter the skill level.

I am working on a detailed WIKI for contribution instructions, but for now
- fork the repo and post the PR
- try to keep the same style as for other views
- edit YOURVUEW.swift file with...you guessed it, your view! (rename it of course)
- design is paramount here, but even if the design is not up to par, i can hop in and modify it further
- not all views will be approved to avoid over-saturation in certain types of views. So please keep that in mind.
