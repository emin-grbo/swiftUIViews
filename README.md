## Contributing 

First of all, THANK YOU! ðŸŽ‰
Any type of contributions are more than welcome, no matter the skill level.

I am working on a detailed WIKI for contribution instructions, but for now:
- fork the repo and post the PR
- try to keep the same style as for other views
- use ViewTemplate.swift file as...you guessed it, a temaplate
- design is paramount here, but even if the design is not up to par, i can hop in and modify it further, so no worries in regards to your design skills.
- not all views will be approved to avoid over-saturation in certain types of views. So please keep that in mind ðŸ™ƒ
