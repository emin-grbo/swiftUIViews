#warning("""
    CONTRIBUTORS ðŸ“£: I marked some warning below so you would know which parts to edit.
    It is really important to keep more or less same style of code throughout the site,
    so you will most likely change the code below line #45, and initialize that view on line #38.
    Once you are done, feel free to delete warnings in this file.
    Happy designing!!
